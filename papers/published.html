Lowering exports is considered as one of the paramount reasons of widening trade deficit of Pakistan, which has become a long-standing challenge that country is facing since the beginning of the century. During the last two decades, the contribution of exports in GDP has been declined from 16 to 10 percent (World Bank, 2021). If we look at Pakistan’s share in global trade, it is dropped from 0.15 percent in 2005 to 0.12 percent in 2021. Export competitiveness of Pakistan is shrinking, while the competitors like Bangladesh, India, and Vietnam are experiencing expansion in export competitiveness. The stagnancy in Pakistan’s exports brings about a number of challenges like increasing current account deficit, burden of foreign debt, exchange rate, and other macroeconomic problems (Government of Pakistan, 2021-22; Defever, et al. 2020). Various reasons of declining export are suggested by the economists and researchers. To gather concrete evidence, a comprehensive desk review or literature review is required to unleash what factors are bringing down Pakistan’ exports. For that purpose, the underlying piece of research aims to weave up a review of existing literature on exports and unfolds the significant factors which influence exports.

Over the last three decades, the environment has become a hotly discussed topic all over the world. The United Nations has set up seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to achieve a standard of sustainable practices in the world including both developed and developing countries. Among these goals, the environment is regarded as a primary concern for all countries. The purpose of this research is to identify potential environmental indicators and challenges in organizational settings. This paper specifically investigates the impact of sustainable leadership on the environment, both directly and indirectly, through environmental practices and sustainable culture. Using a sample of 306 organizational personnel and Partial Least Square (PLS) Structural Equation Model (SEM), the results reveal that Sustainable Leadership (SL) have a significant impact on environmental sustainability. The results also indicate that Environmental Practices (EP) and Sustainable Culture (SC) influence Green Performance (GP). Findings of this study reinforce the organization’s concern for environmental sustainability and suggest how organizations and institutions can improve the environment through sustainable leadership. This is the first research to not only empirically study the interaction of SL and GP, but also to throw light on the existing literature by investigating the mediating function of environmental practices and sustainable culture and the underlying relationship.

            In this book theory of well-being is used in all scenarios and the most focused variable was the ultimate well-being, that generates occasions for well-being and happiness (Haybron and Tiberius 2015; Helliwell et al. 2016)) of people. Particularly this book is based on MENA – the Middle East and North Africa. MENA has gained significant importance by scholars and media at international level after the event of Sep 11, 2001, 2008’s financial crisis, spring of 2011 in Arab. Each event has highly effected the politics, societies and wellbeing of people.
